# Changelog

One entry per PR.

## PR 0: Scaffold (2026-10-04)

- Repo layout per BUILD-GUIDE section 1.3. No feature code yet.
- Engine: Python 3.12 with uv. Four packages (agency_schema, synth_agency_data, jev_client, intake), ruff, mypy strict, pytest. Console scripts `intake` and `synth` with a placeholder `version` command.
- Dashboard: Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind), shadcn/ui, vitest, Playwright config.
- Root `npm run verify` runs every check. CI runs it on every push and PR.
- `.claude/settings.json` permissions and a Stop hook that runs verify before Claude can end a turn with uncommitted changes.
- Change from the build guide: Node is pinned to 24, not 20. Node 20 reached end of life on 2026-04-30.
- `typecheck` runs `next typegen` first, because Next 16 generates some page types at build time.

## SPEC: the contract for every PR (2026-10-04)

- SPEC.md written from the SPEC interview. It now overrides the build guide where they disagree.
- PR plan gains "Lane" and "Needs merged first" columns for running lanes in parallel.
- PR 1 splits into 1a (models) and 1b (sample runs that act as the engine-to-dashboard contract).
- PR 3 splits into 3a (defects, planted example records, a canonical-shape copy) and 3b (source files), so rule PRs can start before readers and mapping exist.
- New run output `rts_coverage.json` feeds the Agents page RTS matrix (the guide had no data source for it). `intake/config.py` skeleton moves to PR 1a so lanes don't both create it. PR 11 records the triage and PII cassettes.
- Second review: triage and PII cassettes recorded in PR 12 against real pipeline requests; PR 11 deduplicates triage calls and states the expected call count; ground truth uses stable record keys; PR 13 copies the sample run into dashboard/public/demo-run.
- Jev spend capped at $0.50 per run. Missing an accuracy target in the end-to-end test fails verify.
